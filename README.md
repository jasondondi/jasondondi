I've gotten myself into a position where I have more free time, so thought it would be neat to work on developing skills or pursuing interests that I've put off because I "never had time to..." do whatever. Here's where I'm at: 
My 2022 challenge was to spend the year learning and practicing daytrading. It didn't go too poorly, but didn't go well enough that I kept it up once the year was over. 
My 2023 challenge continued through 2024 as "go back and finish college," so here I am at the University of Nebraska at Omaha learning about business administration and constantly thinking I should have come for cybersecurity or software-something-or-other. 
I had thought my 2024 challenge would be HAM Radio, which I did get licensed for and am working on learning morse, but I think I've got time enouugh to fit something in--that "thing" seems to be HackTheBox or EVE Online, which may significantly impact the amount of otherwise "free time" I have.
